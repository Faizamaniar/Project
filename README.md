# üîê Smart Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator

**Author:** Faiza Maniar  
**Domain:** Cybersecurity | Python | Password Security  
**Project Type:** Internship Project (2025)  


## Overview

The **Smart Password Strength Analyzer** is a Python-based cybersecurity tool designed to evaluate password strength using real-world entropy analysis (zxcvbn) and generate personalized wordlists for awareness and testing purposes.
It helps users understand how predictable personal details (like names, pets, or years) can weaken their passwords ‚Äî a key aspect of cybersecurity training.


## Objective : Build a tool to analyze password strength and generate custom wordlists.

- Analyze password strength using advanced scoring methods.  
- Educate users on password creation and vulnerabilities.  
- Generate a custom wordlist for ethical testing and awareness.  
- Export detailed reports and wordlists automatically.


## Features
- **Advanced Strength Analysis** | Uses `zxcvbn` to calculate password entropy and crack time. |
- **Custom Scoring** | Additional readability score based on character variety and length. |
- **Color-Coded Feedback** | Visual CLI output for quick understanding. |
- **Wordlist Generator** | Builds a personalized wordlist from user input (name, pet, year). |
- **File Export System** | Automatically saves `password_report.txt` and `custom_wordlist.txt`. |


##  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Language:** Python 3.12.4  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `zxcvbn` ‚Üí password strength analysis  
  - `itertools`, `os`, `datetime` ‚Üí wordlist and file management  
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code  


##  How to Run the Project

**Step 1** Install Dependencies
      pip install zxcvbn-python

**Step 2** Run the Program

**Step 3** Choose from Menu
  1. Check password strength
  2Ô∏è. Generate custom wordlist
  3Ô∏è. Exit

**Step 4** Output Files
  - password_report.txt ‚Üí stores password evaluation results
  - custom_wordlist.txt ‚Üí contains generated words for awareness

## Deliverables: Tool that evaluates password strength and exports attack-specific wordlists.

## Screenshots 
1. Code Running
2. Password check
3. Wordlist created
4. Custom wordlist

**Future Improvements**
- Add a simple GUI using Tkinter.
- Visual charts for password statistics.
- Integration with web password audit tools.

## Project Selection

I selected this project because password **security** is a core part of **cybersecurity** awareness. My tool combines both strength analysis and custom wordlist generation to show users how personal data can weaken passwords.It‚Äôs functional, easy to use, and helps demonstrate real password vulnerability concepts.
